# BeanSight-Uncovering-Insights-in-Coffee-Quality
This project leverages the Coffee Quality Institute (CQI) datasets to analyze factors that contribute to coffee quality, focusing on sensory evaluation, defects, and processing methods. 
The goal is to understand the key determinants of coffee quality and their relationships with processing methods, origin regions, and defects. 
The analysis aims to improve decision-making in coffee production and processing to enhance overall coffee quality. 
I have used approaches like i.e. Data Cleaning and Prepossessing, Exploratory Data Analysis, Visualization.
